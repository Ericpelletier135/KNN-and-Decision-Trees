# KNN-and-Decision-Trees
### Abstract
A key element in machine learning is the ability to predict outcomes with the highest accuracy possible.
In this project, we investigated the performance of two machine learning models —K-Nearest Neighbour
(KNN) and Decision Tree— on two benchmark datasets —hepatitis and diabetic retinopathy—. During
the experiments, we tested different numbers of neighbours to consider for the KNN model to evaluate
differences in training data accuracy and test data accuracy, as well as tested maximum tree depth to
appraise the performance of the Decision Tree model. In addition, we evaluated the affects that different
cost functions have on the models. Overall, we found that both KNN and Decision Tree perform very
similarly on the given datasets, with the latter having a slight edge with the larger data set —hepatitis
data set—.

This project was conducted in a group of 3 during the COMP 551 class at McGill University.
